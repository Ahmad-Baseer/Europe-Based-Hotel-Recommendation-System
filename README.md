# How to run the application


### Follow the steps to configure this application:

1. Download all the files and place them in a specific folder. Open up Jupyter Notebook in your working folder.
2. Install the libraries first before running notebooks. Remove the ```#``` sign from the lines to allow nltk to download required files & to see if everything works fine or not.
3. Download the Hotel Reviews dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe)
4. Run the **Hotel_Recommendation_System** file first and then **Hotel Recommendation System Web App**, after running the second one you should see this: **Overwriting Web_App.py** in output.
5. Open up the terminal in the same folder and type this command: ```streamlit run Web_App.py```. It will open your application in your default browser.
6. Now, you can follow any YouTube video to deploy this application.
